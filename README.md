# Underground Smash Overlay - Info, Instructions, Future Plans, To-Do List

## Instructions for Use:

**Important: for now, until I am able to package and deploy this to a web server, you'll need Python and Git installed.**

### Easy Startup (Recommended)

1. Open the `underground-smash-overlay` folder.
2. Double-click the `start-smash-overlay.sh` script or run it from a terminal:
   ```
   ./start-smash-overlay.sh
   ```
3. This will automatically start the application and open it in your default browser.
4. To stop the application, use the `stop-smash-overlay.sh` script:
   ```
   ./stop-smash-overlay.sh
   ```

### Manual Startup

If you prefer to start the application manually:

1. Open the `underground-smash-overlay` folder.
2. Right click somewhere in the folder and open a terminal window.
3. Run the setup script with the following command:
   ```
   bash dev-setup.sh
   ```

## Player/Caster Sponsors

The application now supports adding sponsor information for players and casters:

1. In the player and caster sections, you'll find optional fields for entering sponsor information.
2. The sponsor names will display in gold above the player/caster names in the overlays.
3. Leave the field blank if the player/caster doesn't have a sponsor.

## Visual Character Selection

The application now features a visual character selection interface:

1. Click the "Select Character" button for either player.
2. A grid of all available fighters will appear with images.
3. Click on the desired character to select them.
4. The selected character's image and name will appear below the selection button.
5. You can also select "Random" as a character option, which appears as the first choice in the character grid.

## Quick Actions

The application features a Quick Actions section for common operations:

1. **Score Adjustment**: Use the +1/-1 buttons to quickly adjust player scores.
2. **Swap Players**: The swap button (⇄) exchanges player information between Player 1 and Player 2.
3. **Reset Scoreboard**: The reset button (↺) sets both player scores to 0 and characters to "Random".
4. **Save Changes**: The save button (💾) manually saves all current form values.

## Future Plans:

- Theme switching capability
- Modular theme organization
- Custom logo support

## To-Do List:
