# Improvements

## UI
- improve the form for inputting player data during sets
- ✅ make it easier to select characters for a player
- ✅ add an optional input for the player's sponsor organization
- ✅ add an optional input for the caster's sponsor organization
- add the ability to switch between different themes we have created for the scoreboard, as our tournaments often have different themes

## Scoreboard/Overlays
- organize the themes into more modular sections, with some sort of clear separation
- make it easier to replace the Smash Ball logo in the center of the scoreboard with a custom logo

## Infrastructure
- ✅ ability to more easily start application (not through multiple terminal commands)
- ability to update the overlay using the ui remotely
